Draw Line Plot
This code defines a function draw_line_plot that creates a line plot of the freeCodeCamp forum page views data over time. The x-axis shows the date and the y-axis shows the number of page views.

Draw Bar Plot
This code defines a function draw_bar_plot that creates a bar plot of the average number of page views per month, grouped by year. The x-axis shows the months and the y-axis shows the average number of page views. The legend shows the year labels.

Draw Box Plot
This code defines a function draw_box_plot that creates two box plots using Seaborn. The first box plot shows the distribution of page views for each year, and the second box plot shows the distribution of page views for each month. The x-axis labels for the second box plot are rotated by 45 degrees.

Data Preparation
The df variable contains the page views data, which has been cleaned by removing outliers. The df_bar and df_box variables are copies of the df variable with additional columns added to group the data by year and month.

Plotting
The fig variable is used to save the plots as image files. The plt module from Matplotlib is used to create the plots, and the sns module from Seaborn is used to create the box plots. The register_matplotlib_converters function is used to ensure that the date index is correctly parsed.
